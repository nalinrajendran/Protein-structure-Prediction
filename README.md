# Protein-structure-Prediction
This Is a Q Learning model, which predicts the structure of the given protein Input.


The following AI project uses reinforcement learning to attempt to resolve a condensed form of the Protein Structure Prediction (PSP) problem. Finding the native state of a protein given its amino acid sequence is the focus of the protein structure prediction problem. When a protein is synthesized, it folds rapidly in the space until it reaches a stable form, usually referred to as the Native State. The protein can then perform its designated job after that. 

One of the biggest issues in bioinformatics is predicting the outcome of the folding process in advance. Solving this problem would have significant ramifications for many fields, from biochemistry to genetic engineering.
